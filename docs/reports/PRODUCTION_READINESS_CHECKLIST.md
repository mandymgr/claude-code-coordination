2. ❌ **TypeScript compilation without errors** (currently has auth middleware errors)
3. ❌ **Docker containers built and tested**
4. ❌ **Kubernetes deployment successful**
5. ❌ **Load testing passed (1000+ concurrent users)**
6. ❌ **Security audit completed**
7. ✅ Performance benchmarks met (Phase 4 optimizations)
8. ✅ Documentation complete (comprehensive)

### **Production Metrics Targets:**
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
